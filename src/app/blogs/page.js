       <p className='mt-8'>Preventative measures are the most effective means of warding against skin cancer. Teach your youngsters how to protect themselves. Anyone, but especially children and teenagers, who get severe, blistering sun burns, increases their chance of developing skin cancer. Most types of skin cancers can be avoided easily by taking preventive measures. So, protect yourself from skin cancer by adapting the following measures:</p>

       <h2 className='mt-6 text-[#34476C] text-[20px] font-bold'>Don't go out in sun at midday.</h2>
       <p className='mt-2'>Peak time of sun is from 10 to 4, and most individuals see sunlight during this time. Even if its winter or the sky is gloomy, outdoor activities should be planned for other times of the day. You are potentially facing cancerous ultraviolet rays all the time. You can protect your skin from UV damage and reduce your chance of skin cancer by staying out of the sun while it's at its peak intensity, but this only works if you stay out of the sun altogether. The cumulative sun exposure may also contribute to skin cancer.</p>

       <h2 className='mt-6 text-[#34476C] text-[20px] font-bold'>Always protect your skin by using sunscreen.</h2>
       <p className='mt-2'>Any type of Sunscreen does not provide 100% protection from ultraviolet rays, including those that cause melanoma. However, they're crucial to any strategy for warding off the sun's rays. Even on overcast days, be sure to use a suitable sunscreen with minimum SPF30. Sunscreen should be applied before 20 to 30 mints of sun exposure and reapplied after every two hours, or more often if you are swimming or sweating heavily. Back of your hands, neck, ear lobes are also susceptible to UV damage as the rest of your body. So it is important to apply sunscreen anywhere it's needed.</p>

       <h2 className='mt-6 text-[#34476C] text-[20px] font-bold'>Put on some safety gear</h2>
       <p className='mt-2'>Sunscreens don't prevent all of the sun's harmful rays from penetrating the skin. Wear cloth that can cover your arms and legs, as well as a hat with a wide brim for more protection from the sun. Photo-safe apparel is also available from certain retailers. A dermatologist can advise you on the best brand for your needs. Sunglasses are a must-have item. Try to get ones that protect against both UVA and UVB rays.</p>
       
       <h2 className='mt-6 text-[#34476C] text-[20px] font-bold'>Never use a tanning bed</h2>
       <p className='mt-2'>Intensified exposure to the UV rays emitted by tanning bed lights has been linked to an increased risk of skin cancer.</p>

        <h2 className='mt-6 text-[#34476C] text-[20px] font-bold'>Be aware of the effect of Madison </h2>
       <p className='mt-2'>Aware that there are drugs that might make you more sensitive to the sun. Antibiotics are only one example of a class of medications that might increase your skin's sensitivity to sunlight. Inquire about potential adverse reactions to any drugs you're considering taking. Take special measures to shield your skin from the sun if they make you more photosensitive.</p>

       
        <h2 className='mt-6 text-[#34476C] text-[20px] font-bold'>Skin checkup</h2>
       <p className='mt-2'>Maintain a regular skin examination schedule and inform your doctor of any changes you see. Always be on the lookout for any changes or new moles, freckles, lumps, or birthmarks on your skin. Examine your arms, hand, chest, face, neck, ears, and scalp in mirrors. Check the insides and outsides. Check your inner and outer thighs, as well as the bottoms and in between your toes of both feet. Inspect the space between your legs and genitalia as well.</p>
